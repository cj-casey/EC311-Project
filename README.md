# Tilt
A maze solving game using tilt controls. The user will have to avoid the walls and get to the Maze exit.

## Features

### Accelerometer Motion Controls (Connor)
  We plan to use the ADXL362 accelerometer on board the FPGA to control motion of the ball. This will require both an SPI Master and SPI Interface, but also a denoiser and decoder for the accelerometer.

### Random Maze Generation (Thomas Y.)
  We plan to use generate random mazes for the user to solve.

### Collision Detection (Tom B.)
  We want the user to avoid colliding with the walls or going through them, so will use collision checking

### VGA Display (Aymeric)
  Using VGA display techniques and memory storage, we are going to display a moveable ball and maze on the screen.
