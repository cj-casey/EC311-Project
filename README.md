# Tilt
A maze solving game using tilt controls. The user will have to navigate an ever changing maze and reach the flag to increase score in the alloted time.

## Features

### Accelerometer Motion Controls (Connor)
  We plan to use the ADXL362 accelerometer on board the FPGA to control motion of the ball. This will require both an SPI Master and SPI Interface, but also a denoiser and decoder for the accelerometer.

### Maze Generation (Thomas Y.)
  The map for Tilt is generated by first taking the user inputted overall map size (400x400, 420x420, etc.) and grid amount (4x4, 7,7 etc.) and generates the requested map. The grid sizes are created as a function of the requested map size, thus creating dynamic grids that users can tweak.

The end flag is also programmed as a function of the grid sizes, ensuring that the flag is always centered in the top right grid.

### Collision Detection (Tom B.)
  We want the user to avoid colliding with the walls or going through them, so will use collision checking

### Random Maze Generation and Display (Aymeric)
  The vertical and horiztonal lines of the maze are modulated by two differently clocked linear-feedback shift registers (LFSR) and sampled every second to change the maze every second. The generation of the lines 

### Timer and Score counter (Aymeric)
The player has set number of seconds to reach the flag that depends on the number lines of the maze. The Seven Segment Display also records the number of times the player has reached the end of the maze.

### Hard Mode (Aymeric)
A switch on the Nexys board makes collision with any wall reset to the begining of the maze.

## Overview of the code structure


## How to Run
Add all files in either Final_with_multiple_modes of the Final folder as design sources. Set the top to as top_lines_mov.v. Add the Nexys4DDR_Master_lines.xdc as a constraints file. Run synthesis, implemementation, generate bitstream, and program the device. Connect Nexys 4 to VGA and enjoy.
